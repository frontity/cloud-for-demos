<p><em>“It is never too late to be what you might have been.”</em><br>
<strong>George Eliot</strong></p>
<p>Getting started with doing what you deep down want to do in life can be hard.</p>
<p>No matter if what you want is to start exercising, <a href='https://www.frontity.com/start-wordpress-blog/'>create your own business on the side</a>, write a book, see other parts of the world, <a href='http://premium.frontity.com/self-esteem-course/'>improve your relationship with yourself</a> or something entirely else.</p>
<p>But often we make getting started a lot harder than it needs to be by standing in our own way.</p>
<p>So in today’s article I’d like to share 3 things you need to stop doing to step out of your own way and make it so much easier to actually get started instead of just keep dreaming about it.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><strong>1. Stop making it a huge and vague thing in your mind.</strong></p>
<p>The more you think about whatever you want to get started with the bigger it tends to become in your head.</p>
<p>And as you keep thinking about the various ways this could go it tends to become scarier and scarier.</p>
<p><strong>So do this instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get knowledge from the others who have been where you want to go.</strong> To defuse vague fears about what could happen if you got started and about the unclear unknown, get information from people who have already gone where you want to go.<br>
It is easier than ever to find them today. Look them up online and read what they have written and said or send them an email. Or go ask someone you know in real life that has done what you want to do.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask yourself: Honestly, what is realistically the worst that could happen?</strong> Take a couple of deep breaths to calm down your mind a bit. Then ask yourself this question.<br>
You’ll realize that in most cases the worst thing that could realistically happen is not that bad. It may sting for a bit. But it is something you can handle. And it is a situation you can find something to do about if this worst case scenario were to happen.<br>
The clarity you get from this question can – in my experience – reduce fears quite a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Stop trying to control everything.</strong></p>
<p>Being prepared and knowing some things certainly helps.</p>
<p>But it can become a trap when you try to control it all or <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-stop-overthinking/'>think things through 50 times</a> to be on the safe side and to not risk making mistakes, fail or look like a fool.</p>
<p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Realize: you will stumble and that is OK.</strong> It happens to anyone who steps outside of his or her comfort zone. It has happened to everyone you may admire and who have lived a life that is inspiring.<br>
It is simply a part of a life well lived. And if you reflect on what you can learn from a mistake then that will be invaluable to help you grow and improve.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn to set time-limits for small decisions at first.</strong> If you have trouble with overthinking then set a time-limit for when you have to make a decision. This might seem a bit scary though.<br>
So start small and set a 30-60 second time-limit when trying to decide if you are going to work out or reply to an email.<br>
Do that for a while and then move on to slightly bigger decisions. And then even bigger ones after that.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Stop thinking that you have to get started in a big and spectacular way.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a big goal or dream or even a medium sized one then it is easy to think that you have to take an action of the same size to get started or to get where you want to go.</p>
<p>That is most often not true though.</p>
<p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go small.</strong> Just ask yourself: what is one small step I can take today to get the ball rolling with my goal/dream? Then take just that small action. And tomorrow or later on today you can do the same thing again. If that question still lands you in procrastination then ask yourself: What is one tiny step I can take to get the ball rolling?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-task each little step.</strong> Focus on just the one step you are taking. Nothing else. Otherwise it is easy to get lost in thought, to go off track or to <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-stay-positive/'>feel uncomfortable</a> or fearful. So keep your attention on just this one action and step forward.<br>
And after that, the next one. Let these actions build day after day into something bigger. And before you know it you’ll have gone quite a distance on your journey.</li>
</ul>

<p>Love this!</p>
<p>I learned my big life lesson from a little boy. It was from a movie based on a true story &#8211; mum and boy were kidnapped. What an awful situation they must be in, right? If I were him, I&#8217;d be crying all day long, lying on the bed like I&#8217;m already dead. But no, he&#8217;d start his day with a pleasant morning ritual with greetings to all objects around him &#8211; &#8220;Good morning, bed. Good morning Curtain, Good morning, Cup&#8221; and so on. </p>
<p>It taught me we could see millions of things around us that we could be grateful for. Happiness is like air. It&#8217;s with us, everywhere. Go through everything around you and you&#8217;ll see there are already SO many things that make us happy and grateful. </p>
<p>No time to feel sorry for ourselves :)</p>
<p>(Oh, don&#8217;t worry the boy and mun have their happy ending.)</p>

<p>When you fail, make a mistake or things simply don’t go as well as you had hoped then how do you feel?</p>
<p>Do you feel sorry for yourself? Well, that’s natural in some situations and too an extent.</p>
<p>But do you get stuck in that mental state too often and for far too long?</p>
<p>If that’s the case then this guide is for you.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Because in it I’d like to share 10 steps that have helped me to <a href='https://premium.frontity.com/self-esteem-course/'>stop feeling sorry for myself</a>.</p>
<p>Simple habits and techniques that have helped me to reduce and overcome this issue in my life and to stop spending so much time and energy on it.</p>
<p>Now, let’s get started.</p>
<p><strong>1. Breathe.</strong></p>
<p>First, calm your mind and body down a bit to think more level-headedly and clearly.</p>
<p>This simplest way to do that?</p>
<p>Just sit down. Close your eyes.</p>
<p>And then breathe through your nose and with your belly.</p>
<p>Focus only on the air going in and out. Nothing else.</p>
<p>Do that for 1-2 minutes (I like to set a timer on my smart phone so I don’t try to finish early).</p>
<p>This will center you and make you feel more focused again.</p>
<p><strong>2. Zoom out into the world (and then tap into gratitude).</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself: does anyone on this planet have it worse than me right now?</p>
<p>This question helps me to see things from a wider perspective.</p>
<p>I often follow it up with asking myself:</p>
<p>What are 3 things I can be grateful for but often take for granted?</p>
<p>Well, I can be <a href='https://www.frontity.com/grateful-when-times-are-tough/'>thankful for many such things</a>.</p>
<p>Thing like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh water.</li>
<li>Three steady meals a day.</li>
<li>A roof over my head.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just these first two steps is often enough for me stop feeling sorry for myself and <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12693515'>not get stuck in self-pity</a>.</p>
<p>If not, then I move on to…</p>
<p><strong>3. Zoom out in your own life.</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself this about the situation that has caused you to feel sorry for yourself:</p>
<p>Will this matter in 5 years? Or even 5 weeks from now?</p>
<p>The answer is most usually for me that it actually won’t.</p>
<p>But I’m sometimes a bit hasty to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p><strong>4. Find one opportunity or lesson in the situation you’re in.</strong></p>
<p>This can help you to see what happened to you <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-stay-positive/'>in more optimistic and constructive light</a>.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that it’s all of a sudden a great situation that you’ve found yourself in.</p>
<p>But it’s in my experience important to do not only to add a dash of optimism.</p>
<p>But also because the toughest situations that I’ve felt the worst about have helped me in the long run.</p>
<p>They have taught me one or several very important lessons that have been game-changers or at least been quite valuable things to keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>5. Set a time-limit for yourself.</strong></p>
<p>One thing I do from time to time when I’m in a negative emotional state like feeling sorry for myself or seeing things through a negative lens is to be OK with that.</p>
<p>To embrace it.</p>
<p>But with a deadline and for just a little while.</p>
<p>Because we have to process what has happened. Take in all the emotions, thoughts or shock that a situation caused.</p>
<p>Pushing that aside right away can lead to those thoughts and feelings popping up later in unexpected situations and ways.</p>
<p>So take 10 minutes to just feel sorry for yourself. But then, as those minutes are up, move on into a more constructive headspace and focus forward once again.</p>
<p><strong>6. Get out of your own head by helping someone else out.</strong></p>
<p>To avoid getting stuck in a downward spiral of self-pity focus outward. On someone else. Focus on giving one or more people in your life value.</p>
<p>This will get you outside of your own head and you’ll feel good for helping out in some way.</p>
<p>And then feel even better as you see the other person’s face light up thanks to what you did.</p>
<p>A couple of good ways to give value and to help out are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helping out practically.</strong> Maybe someone needs help moving. Or setting up things for his party this weekend. Or with finding information for a decision that he’s making.</li>
<li><strong>Listening.</strong> Just be there fully and listen to someone as she vents about a situation in her life. And if she asks then offer some advice or a discussion about what can be done to improve upon the situation she is in.</li>
<li><strong>Be kind to someone in your everyday life.</strong> Be kind to a stranger by holding up the door, letting him or her into your lane while driving or helping out with directions if he seems lost in your city.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Look into your possible future.</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself: what will the consequences be if I keep this up?</p>
<p>How will my life look in 1 year if I too often fall back into feeling sorry for myself for too long? And in 5 years?</p>
<p>How will it affect my relationships?</p>
<p>How will affect my chances of reaching my goals and dreams?</p>
<p>Write down your answers and use them as a motivation to move forward once again the next time you feel that you’re starting to get lost in those negative thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>8. Create a reminder and keep it close by.</strong></p>
<p>I used one that said “no victim thinking for 30 days” on my smart phone. It popped up every morning with the help of the free <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&amp;hl=en'>Google Keep app</a>.</p>
<p>Another good way to use a reminder is to write your message to yourself down on a piece of paper and put it in your bedside table. Then it’ll be one of the first things you see each day.</p>
<p>A couple of suggestions for what to write could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s OK to feel sorry for yourself for 10 minutes. But then move forward and into action again.</li>
<li>What are 3 things I can be grateful for in my life but I too often take for granted?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Draw up a small plan (and take just one step to move forward with it).</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to move on from a mental state where you don’t feel like you have much personal power to change your situation is to take one small step.</p>
<p>And to create a small plan – or the start of one – for how you can improve or move away from the situation that have made you feel sorry for yourself.</p>
<p>So just sit down with a pen and a piece of paper. And brainstorm for 3-5 minutes to find one or a few small steps forward.</p>
<p>Then get the ball rolling right away.</p>
<p>Take just one of those small or tiny steps forward to put your plan into action. This will make you, in my experience, feel empowered and better about yourself and your life.</p>
<p><strong>10. Ask yourself: how can I prevent getting stuck in the same trap in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Finally, after you feel more empowered and constructive and have gotten the ball rolling with your plan take a couple of minutes and ask yourself the question above.</p>
<p>Think about what you can do differently the next time <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-overcome-failure/'>something goes wrong</a> or when you start feeling sorry for yourself for too long.</p>
<p>A couple of the things that have helped me the most with this are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading through the note</strong> with the future consequences written on it.</li>
<li><strong>Reminding myself to talk to someone</strong> about it as soon as possible to be able to vent and figure things out for myself.

<p>It makes life feel lighter and not so burdensome.</p>
<p>It opens up new paths towards where you want to go and it helps you to more easily overcome setbacks (and often get something good out of them).</p>
<p>You’ll feel less worried and <a href='http://premium.frontity.com/self-esteem-course/'>sorry for yourself</a> and more motivated to keep taking action.</p>
<p>So the benefits of optimism are great.</p>
<p>But how do you adopt this habit?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Well, learning to think in a less pessimistic and more positive way may sound a bit vague.</p>
<p>So in this week’s article I want to break it down into 10 practical tips and smaller habits that you can start using today.</p>
<p><strong>1. Start replacing the negativity in your surroundings and life.</strong></p>
<p>What you let into your mind during your regular day will have a big effect on how you think and feel.</p>
<p>So start questioning what you let into your mind.</p>
<p>You can do that by asking yourself:</p>
<p>What are the top 3 sources of negativity in my life?</p>
<p>It could be someone close to you or at work or in school. A website you visit often. A magazine, TV-show, podcast, music and so on.</p>
<p>Then take out a piece of paper and or an empty document on your smart phone and ask yourself:</p>
<p>What can I do to spend less time with these 3 sources this week?</p>
<p>Come up with ideas and action-steps for doing that on your piece of paper or in your phone.</p>
<p>If you can’t come up with steps for doing that with all 3 right now then focus on doing it with just one of the sources.</p>
<p>And then, during the next 7 days, spend the time you’ve now freed up on the most positive sources and people in your life.</p>
<p><strong>2. When you’re in what looks like a negative situation, find what’s good or helpful about it.</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest differences between an optimist and someone who lets pessimistic thoughts cloud his mind is how that person perceives <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-overcome-failure/'>a setback or obstacle in life</a>.</p>
<p>I used to, for example, feel like giving up and going home when I stumbled into a negative situation.</p>
<p>It felt like it was permanent place I got stuck in and that whatever I did it would not make much of a difference anyway. And so my mind filled up with pessimistic thoughts and I often beat myself up for whatever I had done.</p>
<p>These days I go about things a differently.</p>
<p>When I find myself in a situation that looks bleak or negative I ask myself questions that will empower me and help me to grow.</p>
<p>Questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would my best friend or parent support and help me in this situation?</li>
<li>What’s one good thing about this situation?</li>
<li>What’s one thing I can learn from this?</li>
<li>What’s one thing I can do differently the next time to likely have a better outcome?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Work out regularly.</strong></p>
<p>When I have a tough time thinking myself out of negative thoughts then a short 20-30 minute workout with free weights can help me to change my headspace.</p>
<p>It is time well spent because <a href='https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/exercise-and-stress/art-20044469'>it releases so many inner tensions and stress</a>, worried feelings and makes me feel stronger again.</p>
<p>It focuses my mind and when I’m done with the workout then I’m in a much better place to handle what is going on in my life right now.</p>
<p>Working out several times a week on a regular schedule also helps me to prevent getting stuck in a pessimistic funk in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>4. Stop making mountains out of a molehill.</strong></p>
<p>This used to be one of my biggest issues. I blew up small or medium-sized issues or challenges into monsters in my mind.</p>
<p>Not a good habit if you want to take action to move forward or if you don’t want a lot of worries and fear in your daily life.</p>
<p>The easiest way to ground yourself in a situation where you start to sense that you may be making a mountain out of a molehill is in my experience to zoom out a bit on your life by using a question like:</p>
<p>Will this matter in 5 years? Or even 5 weeks?</p>
<p>I have found that answer for me is almost always that it honestly won’t.</p>
<p><strong>5. Be grateful for a few of the things you may often take for granted.</strong></p>
<p>When your lens that you view your daily life through is tinted in a negative way then <a href='https://www.frontity.com/grateful-when-times-are-tough/'>it’s easy to miss the things you can actually be grateful for</a>.</p>
<p>The things you have that many, many in the world do not have or things you may take for granted.</p>
<p>Take a minute as you get out of bed in morning or get into it in the evening and put your attention on a few such things.</p>
<p>A handful of the ones I most often come back to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three steady meals a day.</li>
<li>A roof over my head during the rainy days and long, cold seasons here in Sweden.</li>
<li>As much clean water as I want.</li>
<li>The kind and helpful family and friends I have in my life.</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is also a great way to change your perspective when you have a setback or a failure.</p>
<p>Take a minute or more then to reflect on what you can be thankful for.</p>
<p><strong>6. Come back to this moment (and stay here).</strong></p>
<p>When you’re on the train of negative thoughts then you’re often thinking about something that happened.</p>
<p>You’re reliving it. Thinking again and again about what you could or should have done or said.</p>
<p>Or you’re thinking about something that could happen.</p>
<p>Or maybe a mix of the two of them as a past experience or two build a monster in your mind about what the future may bring.</p>
<p>To get out of any of those places <a href='https://www.frontity.com/stay-present/'>snap back into this present moment</a>. To what is right here, right now.</p>
<p>If you make this a habit and try to spend more of your day in this present space then you’ll have a fewer negative thoughts and be more focused on what is good and what you can do in this very moment in time to move forward.</p>
<p>So how do you do it practically?</p>
<p>A couple of my favorite ways to bring myself to back to being mindful and into this moment are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spend 1-2 minutes on just taking in the world around you.</strong> Take a very quick break and just focus to 100% on what is around you right now. The sights. The smells. How the sun warms your skin or how your clothes feel. The people walking by your window and the sounds of the kids playing a little further away.</li>
<li><strong>Spend 1-2 minutes on just focusing on your breathing.</strong> Take a little deeper breathes than you usually do. Make sure you breathe with you belly and through your nostrils. During this short break only focus on the air going in and out of you and nothing else.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Let it out.</strong></p>
<p>If you let negative thoughts bounce around in your mind then they’ll drag you down.</p>
<p>A workout can help you to release them. Or you can use questions that promote <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894461/'>optimistic thinking</a> as described above.</p>
<p>Another thing that works really well is to just let it out.</p>
<p>To talk the negative situation over with someone close to you.</p>
<p>Venting for a few minutes can really help to find a new and more grounded perspective on the situation. As the other person listens you can figure things out for yourself and what you want to do about it.</p>
<p>Or you may want more active help.</p>
<p>If the two of you have a conversation about the situation then you can together find a more helpful perspective and perhaps even the start of an action-plan for what you can do to make things better.</p>
<p><strong>8. Bring the positivity to someone else’s life.</strong></p>
<p>When you get stuck in a pessimistic mindset or victim thinking then one of the simplest ways to get out of that and out of your own head is to <a href='https://www.frontity.com/optimism-positive-energy/'>bring the positivity to someone in your life</a>.</p>
<p>By adding it and seeing him or her light up and become happier you’ll feel better about yourself and more optimistic again.</p>
<p>Here’s three ways you can do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be kind.</strong> Give a genuine compliment about her great taste in music or his cooking, hold up the door or let someone into your lane while driving your car.</li>
<li><strong>Help out.</strong> Give some good advice that has worked well for you when you’ve been in the same situation that your friend or co-worker is in right now. Or help out with setting up your friend’s party this weekend or as he’s moving to a new apartment next week.</li>
<li><strong>Just be there.</strong> Listen as she vents. Or talk her difficult challenge or situation over to help her to start finding her way out of it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Go slowly.</strong></p>
<p>When I go too fast, when I think, talk and move around too fast then things don’t go that well.</p>
<p>Stress builds up and it becomes harder to think clearly and level-headedly.</p>
<p>Negative thoughts start to swirl around in my mind more often and it’s tough to handle or put a stop to them.</p>
<p>If I on the other hand slow down then my mind and body calms down too.</p>
<p>It becomes easier to once again find the optimistic perspective and a constructive way forward towards what I want.</p>
<p><strong>10. Get a positive start to your day.</strong></p>
<p>The first few things you do in the morning often set the tone for your whole day.</p>
<p>If you get off to a negative or pessimistic start then it can be quite hard to shake those feelings or perspective.</p>
<p><a href='https://www.frontity.com/great-start-to-your-day/'>But if you get your morning off to a positive start</a> then it becomes a lot easier to stay with that emotion and the optimism all the way to when it’s bedtime.</p>
<p>A couple of simple ways to get your day off to a positive start is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A quick reminder on your bedside table or bathroom mirror.</strong> It could be a quote that truly inspired you. Or your most important focus or dream right now. Write it down on a piece of paper and put it where you’ll see within the first 1-3 minutes after you wake up.</li>
<li><strong>Get some positive information or conversation flowing into your mind.</strong> You can do that by listening to a podcast or some of your favorite music, by reading an uplifting blog post or a chapter in a book that makes you laugh. Or you can have a fun or motivating conversation with your kids, partner, co-worker or friend over breakfast or as you ride the bus to school or work.</li>

<p><em>“It is never too late to be what you might have been.”</em><br>
<strong>George Eliot</strong></p>
<p>Getting started with doing what you deep down want to do in life can be hard.</p>
<p>No matter if what you want is to start exercising, <a href='https://www.frontity.com/start-wordpress-blog/'>create your own business on the side</a>, write a book, see other parts of the world, <a href='http://premium.frontity.com/self-esteem-course/'>improve your relationship with yourself</a> or something entirely else.</p>
<p>But often we make getting started a lot harder than it needs to be by standing in our own way.</p>
<p>So in today’s article I’d like to share 3 things you need to stop doing to step out of your own way and make it so much easier to actually get started instead of just keep dreaming about it.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><strong>1. Stop making it a huge and vague thing in your mind.</strong></p>
<p>The more you think about whatever you want to get started with the bigger it tends to become in your head.</p>
<p>And as you keep thinking about the various ways this could go it tends to become scarier and scarier.</p>
<p><strong>So do this instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get knowledge from the others who have been where you want to go.</strong> To defuse vague fears about what could happen if you got started and about the unclear unknown, get information from people who have already gone where you want to go.<br>
It is easier than ever to find them today. Look them up online and read what they have written and said or send them an email. Or go ask someone you know in real life that has done what you want to do.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask yourself: Honestly, what is realistically the worst that could happen?</strong> Take a couple of deep breaths to calm down your mind a bit. Then ask yourself this question.<br>
You’ll realize that in most cases the worst thing that could realistically happen is not that bad. It may sting for a bit. But it is something you can handle. And it is a situation you can find something to do about if this worst case scenario were to happen.<br>
The clarity you get from this question can – in my experience – reduce fears quite a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Stop trying to control everything.</strong></p>
<p>Being prepared and knowing some things certainly helps.</p>
<p>But it can become a trap when you try to control it all or <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-stop-overthinking/'>think things through 50 times</a> to be on the safe side and to not risk making mistakes, fail or look like a fool.</p>
<p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Realize: you will stumble and that is OK.</strong> It happens to anyone who steps outside of his or her comfort zone. It has happened to everyone you may admire and who have lived a life that is inspiring.<br>
It is simply a part of a life well lived. And if you reflect on what you can learn from a mistake then that will be invaluable to help you grow and improve.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn to set time-limits for small decisions at first.</strong> If you have trouble with overthinking then set a time-limit for when you have to make a decision. This might seem a bit scary though.<br>
So start small and set a 30-60 second time-limit when trying to decide if you are going to work out or reply to an email.<br>
Do that for a while and then move on to slightly bigger decisions. And then even bigger ones after that.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Stop thinking that you have to get started in a big and spectacular way.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a big goal or dream or even a medium sized one then it is easy to think that you have to take an action of the same size to get started or to get where you want to go.</p>
<p>That is most often not true though.</p>
<p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go small.</strong> Just ask yourself: what is one small step I can take today to get the ball rolling with my goal/dream? Then take just that small action. And tomorrow or later on today you can do the same thing again. If that question still lands you in procrastination then ask yourself: What is one tiny step I can take to get the ball rolling?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-task each little step.</strong> Focus on just the one step you are taking. Nothing else. Otherwise it is easy to get lost in thought, to go off track or to <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-stay-positive/'>feel uncomfortable</a> or fearful. So keep your attention on just this one action and step forward.<br>
And after that, the next one. Let these actions build day after day into something bigger. And before you know it you’ll have gone quite a distance on your journey.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“It is never too late to be what you might have been.”</em><br>
<strong>George Eliot</strong></p>
<p>Getting started with doing what you deep down want to do in life can be hard.</p>
<p>No matter if what you want is to start exercising, <a href='https://www.frontity.com/start-wordpress-blog/'>create your own business on the side</a>, write a book, see other parts of the world, <a href='http://premium.frontity.com/self-esteem-course/'>improve your relationship with yourself</a> or something entirely else.</p>
<p>But often we make getting started a lot harder than it needs to be by standing in our own way.</p>
<p>So in today’s article I’d like to share 3 things you need to stop doing to step out of your own way and make it so much easier to actually get started instead of just keep dreaming about it.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><strong>1. Stop making it a huge and vague thing in your mind.</strong></p>
<p>The more you think about whatever you want to get started with the bigger it tends to become in your head.</p>
<p>And as you keep thinking about the various ways this could go it tends to become scarier and scarier.</p>
<p><strong>So do this instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get knowledge from the others who have been where you want to go.</strong> To defuse vague fears about what could happen if you got started and about the unclear unknown, get information from people who have already gone where you want to go.<br>
It is easier than ever to find them today. Look them up online and read what they have written and said or send them an email. Or go ask someone you know in real life that has done what you want to do.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask yourself: Honestly, what is realistically the worst that could happen?</strong> Take a couple of deep breaths to calm down your mind a bit. Then ask yourself this question.<br>
You’ll realize that in most cases the worst thing that could realistically happen is not that bad. It may sting for a bit. But it is something you can handle. And it is a situation you can find something to do about if this worst case scenario were to happen.<br>
The clarity you get from this question can – in my experience – reduce fears quite a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Stop trying to control everything.</strong></p>
<p>Being prepared and knowing some things certainly helps.</p>
<p>But it can become a trap when you try to control it all or <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-stop-overthinking/'>think things through 50 times</a> to be on the safe side and to not risk making mistakes, fail or look like a fool.</p>
<p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Realize: you will stumble and that is OK.</strong> It happens to anyone who steps outside of his or her comfort zone. It has happened to everyone you may admire and who have lived a life that is inspiring.<br>
It is simply a part of a life well lived. And if you reflect on what you can learn from a mistake then that will be invaluable to help you grow and improve.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn to set time-limits for small decisions at first.</strong> If you have trouble with overthinking then set a time-limit for when you have to make a decision. This might seem a bit scary though.<br>
So start small and set a 30-60 second time-limit when trying to decide if you are going to work out or reply to an email.<br>
Do that for a while and then move on to slightly bigger decisions. And then even bigger ones after that.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Stop thinking that you have to get started in a big and spectacular way.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a big goal or dream or even a medium sized one then it is easy to think that you have to take an action of the same size to get started or to get where you want to go.</p>
<p>That is most often not true though.</p>
<p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go small.</strong> Just ask yourself: what is one small step I can take today to get the ball rolling with my goal/dream? Then take just that small action. And tomorrow or later on today you can do the same thing again. If that question still lands you in procrastination then ask yourself: What is one tiny step I can take to get the ball rolling?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-task each little step.</strong> Focus on just the one step you are taking. Nothing else. Otherwise it is easy to get lost in thought, to go off track or to <a href='https://www.frontity.com/how-to-stay-positive/'>feel uncomfortable</a> or fearful. So keep your attention on just this one action and step forward.<br>
And after that, the next one. Let these actions build day after day into something bigger. And before you know it you’ll have gone quite a distance on your journey.</li>
</ul>
